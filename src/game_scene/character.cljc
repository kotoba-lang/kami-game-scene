  "Brainrot-character data tier — `game`'s parametric character
  definitions (`game.island-gen/brainrot-characters`) as parity-tested
  EDN. Restored from the legacy kami-engine/kami-game-scene Rust crate's
  `character.rs` (deleted in kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82) as part of
  the clj-wgsl migration (ADR-2607010930, com-junkawasaki/root).

  Mesh / scene generation stays native `game.scene`; only the init-time
  **description** — the per-character `CharacterDef` (JSON-LD id/name/role
  + appearance + spawn points) — moves to EDN (ADR-0046 / ADR-0038).
  [[characters-from-edn]] rebuilds the real
  `game.island-gen/character-def` list, asserted `=` the compiled-in
  `brainrot-characters` in `test/game_scene/character_test.cljc`.

  Zero-dep portable CLJC."
